Trajectory optimization is a local method, it only explores the neighborhood of an initial seed, besides, in the direct transcription, we discretize along the trajectory instead of every dimension of the C-space, thus it scales well in high dimensional space. But RRT is a global method, what makes it efficient in exploring a collision-free path in high dimensional space?

* Voronoi bias, the nodes in the search tree with the largest Voronoi regions tend to be selected for exploration.
* It does not explicitly construct the C-space. We leave the planing "in the dark", the only light is provided by a collision detection algorithm.

But how about the cost of searching for the nearest neighbors?
