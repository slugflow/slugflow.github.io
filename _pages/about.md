I am currently a PhD student at [Robotic Manipulation Lab](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/), [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en), supervised by Prof. [Kensuke Harada](http://www.hlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/harada/). Before my PhD studies, I obtained my master's degree in 2019 from [the University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) and Bachelor's degree in 2016 from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests include: 
1. Task planning for mobile manipulators. Specifically, I plan the positions for the mobile manipulator to efficiently and robustly pick-and-transport objects stored in different locations.
2. Motion planning for nonholonomic mobile manipulators. Both optimization- and sampling-based methods are used in my research.
